## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[n/a]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[The biggest challenge with this prework assignment was understating how exactly the html, js, and the css files work together or "talk" to 
each other. I began to understand it throughout the project. The prework gave reasoning for everything in the project so I was able to understand why and 
how, while working on the prework. How I began to understand was relating it to python/C++ classes and each css or html file worked like its own class. From 
there I was able to complete the assignment with ample understanding.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[My main question about web devolpment is how all the files work all together. Like I stated earlier, I was most confused on how technically everything communicates.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Personally, I think it would be fun to help change up the concept a little bit instead of pressing buttons. The user 
could do actions. The user could control a character and the first "button" could be playing the piano and you have to replay a short tune. Then you move on and 
have to walk through a maze and take the specific turns given to make it through the maze and so on.]
